Welcome to my personal repository of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) solutions, primarily from LeetCode. This repo contains solutions to problems Iâ€™ve solved as part of my ongoing learning and preparation for technical interviews.

Each solution is written in a clean, structured way often with comments or optimizations and is organized topic wise.

ðŸš€ My goal is to master core problem-solving patterns and deepen my personal understanding of algorithms, while also helping others who may benefit from my solutions.
